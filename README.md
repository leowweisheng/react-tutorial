My solution to the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) with additional improvements 

* Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list
* Bold the currently selected item in the move history list
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win
* When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw
* Highlight the result message

All changes are implemented in */src/index.js*

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
